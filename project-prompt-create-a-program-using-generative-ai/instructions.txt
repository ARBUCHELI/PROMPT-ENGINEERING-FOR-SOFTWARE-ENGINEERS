Naval Battle Game Instructions
------------------------------
Objective:
----------
Sink all the enemy ships hidden on the grid.

Game Setup:
-----------
1. The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
2. Enemy ships of various sizes are randomly placed on the grid.

Gameplay:
---------
1. Click on a cell to target it.
2. If the cell contains a part of an enemy ship, it will turn red (hit).
3. If the cell does not contain a ship, it will turn green (miss).
4. The game provides feedback after each move.
5. Continue targeting cells until all enemy ships are sunk.

Rules:
------
1. Each ship occupies a certain number of adjacent cells either horizontally or vertically.
2. Ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally.
3. The grid is a wrap-around, meaning targeting a cell on the edge will continue on the opposite edge.

Winning:
--------
Win the game by sinking all the enemy ships.

Tips:
-----
1. Pay attention to the grid and try to identify the orientation and size of enemy ships.
2. Keep track of your hits and misses to make educated guesses about ship locations.

Good luck, Commander!
